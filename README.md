# Arbor
ArborGVT is the graph vizualization toolkit.  
This is a fork of the `Arbor.js' project (Copyright 2011 Samizdat Drafting Co.).  
Ported to C# language from JavaScript in March-April 2012 (Copyright 2012 by Serg V. Zhdanovskih).  
Currently (from the beginning of 2016) native C++ version is being developed ([@ruslangaripov](https://github.com/ruslangaripov)).
